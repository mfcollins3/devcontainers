# Development Containers

This repository implements templates and features for development containers. A development container template defines a development container that can be used for a specific purpose such as programming in a language like Go or Python. Development container features are used to add software packages to development containers to add new capabilities to the base container template. For example, if a developer is mostly doing Go development, they may use a template for Go programming. But if the developer needs to run some Python tools, the developer could install a Python feature that will install the Python interpreter and related tools into the development container.
